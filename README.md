### 👋 Hi, I'm David

I'm a Data & Analytics Engineer passionate about turning raw data into actionable insight and building scalable data systems.

- 👀 I'm especially interested in analytics engineering, data infrastructure, and automation workflows
- 🌱 I'm currently grinding LeetCode daily challenges — most recently earned the 100 Days of Coding badge and the March Daily Challenge badge
- 🛠️ I'm working on a dashboard exploring key differences in American society between now and various points in the past — using public datasets to visualize trends in population, inflation, and income
- 💡 I'm looking to collaborate on tools that improve the developer experience in AWS or Google Cloud — especially around data orchestration and monitoring
